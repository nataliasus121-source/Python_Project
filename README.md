### **PYTHON PROJECTS**

**[A/B Test Significance Calculator (Python & SQL)](https://github.com/nataliasus121-source/Python_Project/tree/main/ab_test_significance_calculator)**
* Developed an automated tool to evaluate the statistical significance of product changes across key conversion metrics (Checkout, Account Creation, etc.).
* Implemented a **Two-proportion Z-test** framework using SciPy and Pandas to distinguish real business uplift from random noise with a 95% confidence level.
* Designed a scalable architecture supporting multi-level segmentation by Device, Channel, and Geography to identify hidden performance patterns.


**[E-commerce Sales & Customer Analytics (Tableau, SQL & Python)](https://github.com/nataliasus121-source/Python_Project/tree/main/e-commerce_sales_%26_customer_analytics)**
* Transformed 350k+ raw session records from **BigQuery** into actionable insights regarding revenue drivers and marketing efficiency.
* Identified Organic traffic as the primary revenue driver (34%) and optimized device-specific strategies for a market contributing over $17.6M.
* Created interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize global sales trends and customer engagement metrics.


**[Global Retail Store Analysis (Python)](https://github.com/nataliasus121-source/Python_Project/tree/main/online_store_analysis)**
* Performed end-to-end EDA on a global dataset, managing complex data cleaning, deduplication, and anomaly detection for multi-source tables.
* Analyzed profitability and logistics performance across Europe ($448.5M revenue), discovering that brand demand, rather than shipping speed, was the primary profit driver.
* Applied time-series analysis to identify seasonal trends and weekday sales patterns to optimize inventory planning.
